# Decoding Chess Puzzle Difficulty

# Overview

The project aimed to assess engineered features from chess puzzles to predict their difficulty. It evaluates both traditional ML and deep learning models, analyzing the efficacy of numerical features and encoded grids representing board states and move sequences.

# Problem Statetment and Project Significance

**Background:** Currently, the absence of heuristics or models to initialize puzzle difficulty leads to mismatched levels for chess solvers. The elo system rates puzzles from 100 to 3000+, yet new puzzles start uniformly at 1500 before adjusting. Platforms like Lichess.org rate puzzles based on player success rates, but this process is slow and can impact user experience and their ability to learn.

**Importance of Predictive Modeling:** Developing a predictive model for accurately assessing puzzle difficulty can fill exisiting gaps and provide more precise initial ratings, enhancing the overall users and creators of chess puzzles. Improving puzzle rating accuracy will better match solvers with puzzlesin which can lead to better user engagement, tailored skill development and ultimately, elevate the quality of chess puzzle solving for players of all skill levels.
